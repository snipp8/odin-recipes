    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These chicken scarpariello skewers, alternating garlicky chicken, sausage, and onion, are pan-seared, then baked,
        and dressed with a garlic, pickled pepper, and parsley butter sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil (divided)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 pound Italian sausage, cut into 1 1/4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 small onion, cut into 1 1/4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/3 cup jarred peppadew peppers or cherry peppers (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees F. Combine chicken, 3 tablespoons olive oil, salt, pepper, 1 tablespoon
            garlic, and rosemary in a bowl; stir until chicken is completely coated.</li>
        <li>Thread chicken, sausage, and onion evenly onto 6 wood or metal skewers alternating the pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add skewers and cook undisturbed until browned, about
            4 minutes. Flip skewers and cook for 4 more minutes; transfer skewers onto a sheet pan. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until fully cooked, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, return skillet to medium-high heat and add remaining garlic and peppers. Cook, stirring
            constantly, until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Deglaze the skillet with white wine while scraping bits from the bottom of the pan and cook until mixture is
            reduced by half.</li>
        <li>Add chicken stock and peppadew liquid and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Simmer until reduced by
            half, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn heat off, add butter, and stir until melted. Stir in parsley and drizzle sauce over chicken skewers.
        </li>
    </ol>
