    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The homey recipe captures all of the elements of a quintessential Midwestern hot dish: meat, vegetables, soup,
        and a starch (in this case, mashed potatoes).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 large potatoes (peeled and chopped)</li>
        <li>500 g of ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 can of green beans (drained)</li>
        <li>1 can of carrots (drained)</li>
        <li>1 can of cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 can of condensed tomato soup</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about
            15 minutes. Drain and mash.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are cooking, combine ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and
            stir until beef is evenly browned and crumbly and onion is tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Stir carrots, green beans, and condensed soups into beef mixture. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
            Spread mashed potatoes over beef mixture and sprinkle Cheddar cheese over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are light golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
