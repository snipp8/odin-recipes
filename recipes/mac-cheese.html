    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mac and cheese has a specific flavor and texture that is not only delicious but super nostalgic for many of us.
        But why stop there? Let's upgrade it by smoking it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package sliced bacon (alt, beef bacon)</li>
        <li>1 package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 cups of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 package shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 package shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons barbecue rub</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Preheat a smoker to 275 to 135 to 150 degrees C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Add wood chips
            according to instructions.</li>
        <li>Lay bacon strips in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels; cool
            slightly, about 5 minutes. Place in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until crumbly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water,
            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Combine cream, Cheddar cheese, Colby-Jack cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, butter, and barbecue rub in the
            warm pasta pot; add drained macaroni. Stir well until cheese melts. Transfer to a 9x13-inch aluminum pan;
            sprinkle bacon on top.</li>
        <li>Place the pan on the rack in the preheated smoker; cook until cheese is bubbly, about 3 1/2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
